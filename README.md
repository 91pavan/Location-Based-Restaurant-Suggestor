Location Based Restaurant Suggestor

Written in PHP..

Requires Wamp/Lamp .

A person logs into our application using his facebook account and he specifies the date and time during which he/she is free and plans an outing with his/her friends . He/She invites them.
 His/Her friends set a time comfortable to them and then agree to the plan.
 If they agree, we take the GPS co-ordinates of all of them and using Zomato API, suggest few restaurants/movie theatres by taking a centroid of all their locations thereby creating a facebook event thereby helping them choose a place better and making their outing more enjoyable.
